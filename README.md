# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Project Overview
Louise's play "Fever" came close to its funding goal in a short period of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset we have visualized campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.
